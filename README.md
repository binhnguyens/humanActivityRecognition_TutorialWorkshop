# 1. Instructions for Python Tutorial 1 folder

Please download the Python Tutorial 1 folder. This folder is the template I used.

Included in the folder is 
1. Python Tutorial.ppt
2. Python_Tutorial.ipynb

Please include UCI HAR dataset into the same folder as above, please download it via https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

In result, your folder should look like
1. Python Tutorial.ppt
2. Python_Tutorial.ipynb
3. UCI HAR dataset

The powerpoint is used to give foundation and understanding while the ipynb is used as the example.

Please view the recorded tutorial here: https://youtu.be/b0Yn1c-EDqo




# 2. Instructions for Tetra Workshop Material folder

## Overview
In this workshop, we will go over the follow topics. 

1. Overview of what HAR is
2. ML at a high level
3. HAR in biomedical applications
4. Hands-on ML HAR example using Python

The expected outcome for this workshop is for students to learn what HAR and ML is. Students will understand the steps to take to conduct a machine learning analysis in Python. To do this, I will create a theoretical foundation. Followed by the theory, I will go over code that I have prepared, outlining the steps to take for a ML analysis. The code and recording will be given via my Github, allowing students to follow the code during the lesson and attempt for themselves in their own time.
