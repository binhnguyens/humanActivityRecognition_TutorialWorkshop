# python_public_HAR

Please download the Python Tutorial 1 folder. This folder is the template I used.

Included in the folder is 
1. UCI HAR dataset
2. Python Tutorial.ppt
3. Python_Tutorial.ipynb

The UCI HAR dataset folder is empty, please download it via https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and replace that folder with the downloaded item

The powerpoint is used to give foundation and understanding while the ipynb is used as the example.

Please view the recorded tutorial here: https://youtu.be/b0Yn1c-EDqo
